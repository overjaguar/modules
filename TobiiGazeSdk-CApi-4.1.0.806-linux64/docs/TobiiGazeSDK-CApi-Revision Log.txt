Gaze SDK C API 4.1.0
====================
Changes:
- Support for USB-HID devices also on Linux and Android.
- New API function: tobiigaze_get_connected_eye_trackers. This function can be used to 
  enumerate all connected eye trackers.
- New API function: tobiigaze_set_standard_output_logging. This function can be 
  used to enable logging to standard output.
- Deprecated API function: tobiigaze_list_usb_eye_trackers (replaced by 
  tobiigaze_get_connected_eye_trackers).
- Changed the URL scheme of USB-HID devices from tet-usb to tobii-ttp.
- Stability improvements to the fwupgrade tool.
- Changed the Makefile supplied with the samples on non-Windows platforms so 
  that it doesn't add dependencies to old glibc versions.
- Changed the wxWidgets Makefile so that it works out-of-the-box on Linux. 
  (Assuming that all prereqs have been installed.)
- Removed most dynamic allocations after initialization.

Known Issues:
